# Date of Birth Data Processor

This repository contains a Python script named `dob_task.py` that reads names and dates of birth from a text file (`DOB.txt`) and displays them in a structured format. The script separates the names and birthdates into two distinct sections for clarity and ease of reading.

## Description

The `dob_task.py` script performs the following operations:
- Reads data from a text file named `DOB.txt`.
- Parses the content to separate names and their corresponding dates of birth.
- Prints the names under a "Name" header.
- Prints the birthdates under a "Birthdate" header.
