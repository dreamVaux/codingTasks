# String Manipulation Script

This repository contains a Python script named `manipulation.py` that demonstrates basic string manipulations based on user input. The script performs multiple operations to manipulate a sentence entered by the user and outputs various transformations of that sentence.

## Description

The `manipulation.py` script performs the following operations on a sentence provided by the user:
1. Calculates and displays the length of the sentence.
2. Replaces every occurrence of the last letter in the sentence with '@'.
3. Prints the last three characters of the sentence in reverse order.
4. Creates a new five-letter word using the first three and the last two characters of the sentence.

## Getting Started
