# Folder Structure Creator

This repository contains a shell script named `file_cd.sh` which is designed to help you create and manage a nested folder structure on a macOS system.

## Description

- Creates three top-level directories.
- Navigates into one of these directories.
- Creates three subdirectories within the selected directory.
- Removes two of the newly created subdirectories.

chmod +x file_cd.sh
```
