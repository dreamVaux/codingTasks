# Email Simulator with OOP

This repository contains a Python script named `email.py` that simulates an email system using object-oriented programming principles. The script allows users to manage emails in a simulated inbox environment by reading, listing, and marking emails as read.

## Description

The `email.py` script includes:
- **Email Class**: A class that models an email with properties for the sender's address, subject line, email content, and read status.
- **Inbox Management**: Functions to populate the inbox with emails, list all emails with their read status, and read a specific email by index.

### Features
- Initialize and manipulate email objects.
- List emails with the option to view only unread emails.
- Read and mark emails as read directly through the user interface.
