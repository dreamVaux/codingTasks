# Financial Dataset Analysis Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `Report.ipynb`, which is designed to analyze financial data from a text file named `balance.txt`. The analysis includes deriving insights based on demographics such as ethnicity and marital status, as well as calculating statistical data points.

## Description

The `Report.ipynb` notebook includes code to load data into a DataFrame and analyze it to provide answers to several financial queries. Here are the specific tasks it accomplishes:

- **Data Import**: Loads financial data from `balance.txt` into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Compares the average income based on ethnicity.
  - Determines whether married or single people have a higher average balance.
  - Identifies the highest and lowest income in the dataset.
  - Calculates the total number of credit cards recorded.
  - Counts the records for males versus females.
