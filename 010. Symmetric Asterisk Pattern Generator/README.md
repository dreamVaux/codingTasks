# Symmetric Asterisk Pattern Generator

This repository contains a Python script named `pattern.py` that generates a symmetric pattern of asterisks. The pattern ascends from one asterisk to five and then descends back to one, forming a diamond shape.

## Description

The `pattern.py` script uses an innovative approach by employing a single `for` loop combined with conditional logic to create an ascending and descending pattern of asterisks. The pattern is structured as follows:
- Starts with one asterisk.
- Increases by one asterisk each line until it reaches five asterisks.
- Decreases by one asterisk each line until it returns to one asterisk.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dreamVaux/my_bootcamp_tasks.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory

### Usage

To execute the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python pattern.py
```

or

```bash
python3 pattern.py
```

The script will directly print the asterisk pattern to the console.
