# Student Exam Venue Registration Script

This repository contains a Python script named `student_register.py` designed to facilitate the registration of students for an exam venue by collecting student ID numbers and saving them to a text file. Each entry in the file is formatted with a dotted line for student signatures during the exam.

## Description

The `student_register.py` script automates the process of collecting student IDs for an exam registration:
- Prompts the user for the number of students registering.
- Iteratively collects each student's ID number.
- Writes each ID to a file called `reg_form.txt`, followed by a dotted line for signatures.

## Getting Started
