# Triathlon Award Determination Script

This repository contains a Python script named `award.py` that calculates the total time a participant takes to complete a triathlon and determines the award they will receive based on their performance.

## Description

The `award.py` script performs the following tasks:
- Prompts the user to input the times (in minutes) for each of the three triathlon events: swimming, cycling, and running.
- Calculates the total time taken to complete all three events.
- Determines and displays the award the participant receives based on their total completion time, using predefined time brackets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from the official site at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dreamVaux/my_bootcamp_tasks.git
