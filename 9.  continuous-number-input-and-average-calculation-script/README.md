# Continuous Number Input and Average Calculation Script

This repository contains a Python script named `while.py` that continuously prompts the user to enter numbers until the user indicates completion by entering "-1". Afterward, it calculates and displays the average of all provided numbers, excluding the termination signal "-1".

## Description

The `while.py` script uses a while loop to implement the following functionalities:
- Continuously requests numbers from the user.
