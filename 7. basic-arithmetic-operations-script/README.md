# Basic Arithmetic Operations Script

This repository contains a Python script named `numbers.py` that performs a series of basic arithmetic operations using three integers inputted by the user. The script outputs the results of these operations, showcasing fundamental math functions in Python.

## Description

The `numbers.py` script asks the user to enter three different integers and then performs the following calculations:
1. Computes the sum of all three numbers.
2. Calculates the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
3. Multiplies the third number by the first.
4. Divides the sum of all three numbers by the third number and displays the result.

## Getting Started
