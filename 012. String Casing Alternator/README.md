# String Casing Alternator

This repository contains a Python script named `alternative.py` that performs two specific text transformations:
1. Alternates the casing of each character in a string.
2. Alternates the casing of each word in a string.

## Description

The `alternative.py` script provides two functions:
- **alternate_characters**: Takes a string as input and converts each alternate character to uppercase while the others remain lowercase. For example, "Hello World" becomes "HeLlO WoRlD".
- **alternate_words**: Takes a string as input and alternates the case of each word in the string. For example, "I am learning to code" becomes "i AM learning TO code".
