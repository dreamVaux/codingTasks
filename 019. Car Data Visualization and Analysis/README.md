# Car Data Visualization and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `data_viz_task.ipynb` designed to visualize and analyze automotive data from the `Cars93.csv` dataset. The notebook focuses on creating specific plots to explore relationships within the data and answer analytical questions regarding car performance and characteristics.

## Description

The `data_viz_task.ipynb` notebook guides the user through the process of creating visual representations of the automotive data to facilitate a deeper understanding of various aspects of car performance and specifications. The notebook includes tasks such as generating box plots, histograms, line plots, and bar plots using the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### Visualization Tasks Included

1. **Box Plot**: Comparison of revolutions per mile among Audi, Hyundai, Suzuki, and Toyota.
2. **Histogram**: Distribution comparison of miles per gallon (MPG) in the city versus on the highway.
3. **Line Plot**: Exploration of the relationship between 'Wheelbase' and 'Turning Circle'.
4. **Bar Plot**: Analysis of mean horsepower across different car types (e.g., Small, Midsize).

### Analysis Questions

- Which manufacturer has the highest revs per mile?
- Is it generally more fuel-efficient to drive in the city or on the highway?
- How does the wheelbase affect the turning circle of a car?
- Does the size of a car correlate with its horsepower?

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas and matplotlib libraries

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
```bash
