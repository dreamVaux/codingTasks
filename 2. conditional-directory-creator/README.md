# Conditional Directory Creator

This repository contains a batch file named `ifExample.bat` which is designed to demonstrate conditional directory creation on a Windows system.

## Description

The `ifExample.bat` script provides a simple example of using conditional statements in a batch file to manage directories based on certain conditions. Specifically, it:
- Checks for the existence of a directory named `new_folder`.
- Creates a directory named `if_folder` if `new_folder` exists.
- Uses an if-else structure to create a directory named `hyperionDev` if `if_folder` exists, or creates `new-projects` otherwise.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you are using a Windows operating system as the batch file uses Windows-specific commands.
